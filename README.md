# The Forty Servants App
 Oracle/Divination App
 
 This is a Oracle divination app i made for Tommie Kellys The Forty Servants. It was the first project that i made wich featured both html/css & javascript elements.
 It pulls random cards from a oracle deck and displays them on screen. It also displays various info about each card including a youtube link to the specific card.
